# This is NW6
an easy simple network weathermap by 6illes

## Features
- using [cytoscape] js library
- online design of your network weathermap
- save/load your design and keep history
- value the links (via pubsub of messages)
- monitor your network
- using stack ```node redis expressjs socket.io```

[cytoscape]: https://js.cytoscape.org/

## Installation
I recommend you use [debian]
First install redis server and nodejs ```#> apt install redis nodejs```
- unzip the archive
- install npm modules  ```#>./install.sh```

[redis] is used for pubsub

[expressjs] is used for http/https

[handlebars] is used for html templating

[socketio] is used for websocket

[debian]: http://debian.org
[redis]: http://redis.io
[expressjs]: https://expressjs.com
[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/
[socketio]: https://socket.io/

- execute the weathermap application ```#> node weathermap.js```
- design your network weathermap ```http://localhost:4000/ed```
- load/save your design
- distribute your design ```http://localhost:4000```

Now you need to value the links between your routers.

## Network links

The nodejs script ```#> node query.js``` allows to gather link values listed in ```public/net.txt``` at regular intervals of time and pass it to the weathermap web application via a redis pubsub (publish/subscribe) message.

The current script get the values via simple http requests.

Feel free to write your own collector.

## Network simulation

To help start with NW6 network weathermap, you can use the link simulation script ```#> Ç¹ode simul.js```.

## Commands

In the following :
- node are routers and
- edges are unidirectionnal links.

Midpoints in red between converging edges are used to separate between input and output trafic on the link.

You can create nodes (routers) by a simple ```click``` and change its characteristics. 
Multiple nodes can be modified at once when selected using ```shift``` key.

Change the routers icons by a simple pressing of the ```r``` key.
Change the name of the router by editing its ```Label```, matching its name as in ```public/net.txt```.

You can create edges (links) by a simple ```shift``` and ```click``` between two nodes.
Multiple edges can be modified at once when selected using ```shift``` key.

Change the edges shape by a simple pressing of the ```e``` key.
Change the name of the output link by editing the ```Interface```, matching its name as in ```public/net.txt```.

You can delete your selected nodes or edges by pressing the ```Escape``` key.

Now you need an easy way to organize your nodes and edges on the map.

Nodes and mipoint nodes can be simply moved by a ```click and drag/drop```.
Something cool is the ability to ```automove``` the midpoints. Simply select it and press the ```a``` key. It's that simple.

Selected nodes can be vertically or horizontally aligned on axes via pressing the keys ```x``` and ```y```.

Selected nodes can be vertically or horizontally evenly distributed via pressing the keys ```h``` and ```v```.

It's that easy.

| Key | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| Escape | Delete the selected routers and edges |
| Shift | Select multiple routers and edges or create a link |
| r | Toggle between routers icons |
| e | Toggle between edges shapes straight or curved |
| a | Automove a midpoint node between router nodes |
| x | Align selected router nodes on x axis |
| y | Align selected router nodes on y axis |
| h | Evenly distribute selected router nodes on horizontal axis |
| v | Evenly distribute selected router nodes on vertical axis |
